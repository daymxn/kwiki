# Getting Started

The intention behind kWiki is to let you quickly write your wiki pages in markdown, do some light configuration, and
generate a static website at the click of a button; as such, systems are designed to facilitate straight forward usage.

I'll give you a quick run through of all the systems kWiki has to offer, and then we'll go more in depth in the
following pages.

### Create your documentation

You write your documentation in [Markdown format](), anywhere you want (although the standard is a `docs` directory at the
root of your project).

```
project/
  docs/
    index.mdx
    getting-started.mdx
  src/
  build.gradle.kts
```

### Organize your documentation

You write small json files called `_meta.json` to clarify the ToC (Table of Contents) of your wiki.

```
docs/
    index.mdx
    getting-started.mdx
    _meta.json
```

***_meta.json***
```json
{
  "index": "Overview",
  "getting-started": "Getting Started!"
}
```

### Customize your documentation

When you want to add some customization to your wiki, you can do so in your build script via the `kWikiPluginExtension`.

```kotlin
kWiki {
  theme {
    feedbackLink.set(false)
    githubDocumentation.set("$githubUrl/wiki")
    icon.set(project.file("wiki/logo.ico"))
    navbar {
      logo.set(project.file("wiki/logoWithText.svg"))
      projectIcon.link.set(githubUrl)
    }
    footer {
      enabled.set(false)
    }
  }
}
```

### Build your documentation

When you're ready to see the final product, you can build your wiki with the `kWiki` task:

```bash
./gradlew kWiki
```

This will build your wiki, and export the static html files to whatever output directory you specified in the kWiki
configuration block.

## Publish your documentation

We have [a sample GitHub action you can use]() if you intend to publish to GitHub pages, otherwise you can upload your
static documentation to any hosting provider that supports it.
