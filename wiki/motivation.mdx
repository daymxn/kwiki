# Motivation

One of the most important aspects of engineering [that often gets neglected] is documentation.
I pride myself on my dedication to not only annotating my projects- but documenting them as well. The most convenient way
I've found to do this, at least for myself, is in markdown files. They're easy to ship directly with the source, are
supported natively basically everywhere, and have more than enough features to accomplish any basic task needed. The biggest benefit though,
is that because of how easy they are to write, writing documentation for projects takes next to no cognitive overhead.
The drawback though, is that you are limited to a fairly basic style of consumption. Markdown files are [typically] fairly
bare-bones; which to be fair, is the intention. If you want to make documentation that looks prettier, you typically have
to resort to writing the documentation in a more web-oriented way, like via [react](). There _are_, however, various
tools you can use to do this via markdown instead. In researching these options, I found that I didn't really like any
of the options. The biggest reasons being;

- They lacked modern appeal; visually they looked out-dated
- They don't support static asset generation; I intend to host my documentation via GitHub pages
- They are unnecessarily complex; I want to spend time writing my documentation, not debugging it
- They aren't easy to integrate with existing system I use for my projects; Kotlin and Gradle
- They aren't maintained anymore

To solve this problem, I decided to come up with my own solution.

## Nextra

In my recent ventures down the wiki generation rabbit-hole, I ran across a particularly beautiful theme, with commits
_hours_ ago. That would be none other than [Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra). Huge shout-out
to folks over at [Vercel](), as none of this would be possible without them. Although this could change in the future,
they are the current meat and bones of our doc generation. The only problem is; nextra is built for [Node.js]()
applications (or more appropriately, [Next.js]()).

This is where we come in. We've essentially taken Nextra, and wrapped it in a pretty little package that is
idiomatic to use in Kotlin + Gradle. We expose a [Gradle Plugin]() that exposes [properties]() to which consumers can
[configure their wiki](). We then facilitate that configuration to our own instance of Nextra- and handle all the node
related tasks behind the scenes; taking advantage of Gradle's [task configurations]() and [cache optimizations]() along
the way.

## Result

What do we end up with after all our hard work? An easy to use, and easy to integrate (very important distinction),
tool for doc generation. Moving forward, all I have to do is add a dependency on the kWiki plugin:

```
plugins {
  id("com.daymxn.kwiki")
}
```

Add some configurations:

```
kWiki {
  wikiSourceDirectory.set(project.file("wiki"))
  outputDirectory.set(project.file("docs"))

  theme {
    icon.set(project.file("wiki/logo.ico"))
  }
}
```

And I'm done. I can now spend time _actually writing_ my documentation, and not worrying about how it will function or
look in the end.
