# Writing Wiki Files

################## TODO() - should some text go here? ################## look at the others as well ##################

## Choosing a directory

The first step is choosing where to store your wiki files. By default, kWiki looks for a `docs` directory at the
project level.

Although, you can change this behavior via the `sourceDirectory` property in your kWiki configuration.

```kotlin
kWiki {
    sourceDirectory.set(project.files("documentation"))
}
```

Instead of looking for a directory named `docs`, kWiki will now look in the `documentation` directory for your wiki files.

## Content

Your wiki files should be written in `.md` files under your defined `sourceDirectory`. As far as how your content is written,
kWiki follows the GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) spec. If you're unfamiliar with what that entails, you can read all about it
via [GitHub's formal specification](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

## Easy Edit

On the right side of every page there exists a small text: `Edit this page on GitHub`. Clicking this text will link the
reader to the respective page in your GitHub repo.

By default, this links to the [kWiki](https://github.com/daymxn/kwiki) repo. You can change this to your own by setting
the `githubDocumentation` property of your `ThemeOptions`:

```kotlin
kWiki {
    theme {
        githubDocumentation.set("https://github.com/daymxn/khtml/wiki")
    }
}
```
