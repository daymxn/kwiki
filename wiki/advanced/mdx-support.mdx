## MDX Support

While MDX files are supported, encouraged even, it's important to keep in mind that due to the way kWiki functions,

behaviors:

-> External dependencies (eg; npm modules)

-- including additional features that nextra brings, and how they look
-- note that md files are usable but lack certain features (like the disabling of last edited)
