# Table of Contents (meta files)

## Default Behavior

By default, your wiki files will be sorted alphabetically, including directories.

For example, given the following structure:

```

```

Your output would look like this:

![ss]

## Custom ordering

To change the default behavior, we use something called *meta files*. Create a file with the name `_meta.json` at the
root directory of your wiki files, like so:

```

```

We then populate the meta file with a map of our markdown file names to a string of the desired title, in our desired order:

```

```

![ss]
